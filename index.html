		<h2>About me:</h2>
		<div id="aboutMe"><p>
			Hello, My name is Tim. (friends and famiy may call me Eric), and I am a U.W. graduate looking for work experience. At U.W. Madison, I studied computer science,
		with much of my interest being in A.I. and neural networks. I am willing to admit that I do not have relevant work experience, and I am hoping to fix that. In college,
		though, I can say that I did work on a number of programming projects with other students. In my free time, I write small little programs from time to time as a way to
		keep myself from getting rusty, and I have also taken up learning sql since I've seen multiple job listings prefer applicants that know it. 
		
		<strong><div>Strengths:</div></strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Knows Java, python, & C</li>
			<li>adaptability and quick to learn</li>
			<li>Strong work ethic</li>
			<li>detail-oriented</li>
			<li>communication</li>
			<li>teamwork</li>
			<li>Understands how to use Microsoft Office software</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Values:</strong>
			Whenever I'm working on something, whether it's with other people, or just by myself, my core aim is always dependability. If I say I'm going to finish something,
		I fully intend to, and I do not mean something half-done. I try my best to be as accurate and correct in whatever I'm doing in the most efficient way possible.
		Some might interpret that as me being a perfectionist, and while I admit that I am, I also understand when something has to be perfect or when it has to be punctual.

						the LFW Simulated masked face dataset. For the purposes of feature extraction, it should be noted that we Google's facenet."</td>

		<h2 class="headers">About me:</h2>
		<!--
			Hello, My name is Tim. (friends and famiy may call me Eric), and I am a U.W. graduate looking for work experience. At U.W. Madison, I studied computer science,
		with much of my interest being in A.I. and neural networks. I am willing to admit that I do not have relevant work experience, and I am hoping to fix that. In college,
		though, I can say that I did work on a number of programming projects with other students. In my free time, I write small little programs from time to time as a way to
		keep myself from getting rusty, and I have also taken up learning sql since I've seen multiple job listings prefer applicants that know it. 
		
		Strengths:
			Knows Java, python, & C
			adaptability and quick to learn
			Strong work ethic
			detail-oriented
			communication 
			teamwork
			Understands how to use Microsoft Office software
			
		Values:
			Whenever I'm working on something, whether it's with other people, or just by myself, my core aim is always dependability. If I say I'm going to finish something,
		I fully intend to, and I do not mean something half-done. I try my best to be as accurate and correct in whatever I'm doing in the most efficient way possible.
		Some might interpret that as me being a perfectionist, and while I admit that I am, I also understand when something has to be perfect or when it has to be punctual.
